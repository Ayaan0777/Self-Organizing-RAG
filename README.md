📌 Self-Organising / Self-Healing RAG

Phase-wise Project Plan & Tech Stack

1️⃣ What is RAG (Short & Accurate)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a system where an LLM generates answers using externally retrieved documents instead of relying only on its internal knowledge.

Core idea:

Retrieve relevant context → inject into prompt → generate grounded answer

2️⃣ Why RAG
Problem in LLMs	RAG Solution
Hallucinations	Grounding with real documents
Outdated knowledge	Dynamic retrieval
Private data access	Use internal documents
Costly retraining	No model retraining
3️⃣ Basic RAG Workflow (Minimal)
User Query
 → Query Embedding
 → Vector Search (Top-K)
 → Retrieved Chunks
 → Prompt Augmentation
 → LLM Answer
4️⃣ Core Components (What & Why)
Component	Why Needed	Tech Options
LLM	Generate final answer	GPT / Llama / Mistral
Embedding Model	Semantic search	OpenAI / BGE / E5
Vector DB	Fast similarity search	FAISS / Chroma
Chunking	Better retrieval accuracy	Token-based splitting
RAG Framework	Orchestration	LangChain / LlamaIndex
